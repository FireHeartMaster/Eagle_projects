Here you have the project and design of a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) of an electromyography device ready to be sent to production, i.e., to be sent to the machines capable of printing these boards.

An electromyography device is an equipment that reads the very small electric signals sent by the brain to control the muscles. This device amplifies these tiny signals so we can use them in pratice, being able to be read by analog-to-digital conversors. Usually electromyography is something mainly of the domain of medicine, but some other applications are rising, which was the case of this project, having been developed for an intern university project that I proposed at my university: Ã‰cole Polytechnique.

While the circuit proposed works fine, as demonstrated in my tests, it's not ready to commercial, industrial nor real medical applications. It was not designed with this intent. However it is indeed the perfect start point for further advances and studies.

Someone that knows this kind of circuit may recognize some of a bit classical small structures in the design. Indeed I used my knowledge of electronics together with some approaches I alreay knew worked in other circuits. I assembled them, made the proper calculations and projected the design you can find here.

Make good use. Good luck
